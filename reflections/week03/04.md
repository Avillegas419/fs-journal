> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled.
It should be ensured that when one object changes state, an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

Subject in the Observer pattern has three tasks: i Provide methods to register and remove observer. ii Maintains a list of its observers/subscribers. iii And notify them automatically when any state changes.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

In an observer pattern, all registered handler objects get notifications at the same time and they process the update at same time.

But in a chain of responsibility pattern, handler objects in the chain are notified one by one, and this process continues until one object fully handles the notification.
