## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
   The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export live bindings to functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the import statement.

2. How does export differ from export default?
   The difference between export and export default
   export { variable as default } exports the reference to the exported variable , whereas with export default variable , the importing modules do not receive the reference to the exported variable .

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
   The modules hide unwanted and internal details very safely for better security. It means that a module can access only exported package contents and not all the contents or public/internal API of other modules, so the public in one module is not public to other modules.
