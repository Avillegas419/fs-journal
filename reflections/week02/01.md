## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
   In Java, scope defines where a certain variable or method is accessible in a program

2. What is Hoisting ?

Simply put, it means no matter where you declare functions or variables when the code is executed, theyâ€™re moved to the top of their scope. This is known as hoisting.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
   let is the preferred way to be used at anytime unless you never want it to change.

var can also be used and change but accoriding to the new update es6 you should use let.

constÂ variable cannot be reassigned because it isÂ constant so you used this when you don't need to change the variable.
