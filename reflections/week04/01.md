## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
   some signs for call back hell is the cause of poor coding or messy coding you can avoid this by Create reusable functions and place them in a module to reduce the cognitive load required to understand your code. Splitting your code into small pieces like this also helps you handle errors, write tests, forces you to create a stable and documented public API for your code, and helps with refactoring.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
   Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened.
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

   The most important aspect of avoiding callback hell is moving functions out of the way so that the programs flow can be more easily understood without newcomers having to wade through all the detail of the functions to get to the meat of what the program is trying to do.
