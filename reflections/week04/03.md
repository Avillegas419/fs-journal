## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
   await can be used on its own with JavaScript modules. Note: The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async / await is similar to combining generators and promises. Async functions always return a promise.

2. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?
   await can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value. You can use await when calling any function that returns a Promise, including web API functions

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
   increase the performance and responsiveness of your application, particularly when you have long-running operations that do not require to block the execution. In this case, you can perform other work while waiting for the result from the long running task.

   Organize your code in a neat and readable way significantly better than boilerplate code of the traditional thread creation and handling. with async / await , you write less code and your code will be more maintainable than using the previous asynchronous programming methods such as using plain tasks.
