# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
  this week was a lighter week then the last couple of weeks the pace was good this week and the content of api was really intersting.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  how you can get data from any application with data api

- What are you struggling with?
  being able to get the process corretly most of the times
- What would you count as a victory?

i would count this weekend a victory even though it took me awhile to figure and i was able to get through the first month of java script and i'm hoping as week goes by ill will get faster and better at coding being able to type clean refactor code without a problem and being able to undestand and find the problems quickly and efficantly with out a doubt.
