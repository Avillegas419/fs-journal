## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
   A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

2. What does Stateless mean?
   Stateful means the computer or program keeps track of the state of interaction, usually by setting values in a storage field designated for that purpose. Stateless means there is no record of previous interactions and each interaction request has to be handled based entirely on information that comes with it.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
   Under REST principles, a URL identifies a resource. The following URL design patterns are considered REST best practices: URLs should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
