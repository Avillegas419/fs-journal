## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
   pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
   fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
   rejected: meaning that the operation failed

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
   A promise is a returned object from any asynchronous function, to which callback methods can be added based on the previous function's result. Promises use . then() method to call async callbacks. We can chain as many callbacks as we want and the order is also strictly maintained.
3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
   The main difference between the forms promise.then(success, error) and promise.then(success).catch(error) is that in case if success callback returns a rejected promise, then only the second form is going to catch that rejection.
